# Thursday October 5th MICB 475 Meeting Agenda
## Research Question
After reading the PD paper in greater detail, we realized that (Cristea et al. (2020))[https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mds.28052]  already did PICRUSt2 analysis (supplementary figure 4)[https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1002%2Fmds.28052&file=mds28052-sup-0002-FigureS1.pdf]. Control microbiota was enriched for dietary carbohydrate degradation, PD microbiota rich in nucleic acid degradation & amino acid degradation 

Below are some of the further research questions we have in mind: 
* Sub-clustering of metabolic pathways using PD microbiota data only. The paper discussed two clusters – cluster A being more abundant, cluster B less abundant. Do these two clusters correlate with the shift towards proteolytic metabolic pathways? Literature suggests the PD microbiota is more “diverse” in that it has a high rarity index, but the presence of certain species does not necessarily translate to having the corresponding functions. Our question is if this functional metabolic shift is due to cluster A & cluster B as identified in microbial composition 
If we identified sub-clusters based on functional data, are there any correlations between these clusters to other metadata categories e.g. patient age, depression, anxiety, BMI, drug usage? 
How is lipid metabolism different in PD vs. controls? Is there a difference? PIECRUSt2 figure only displays carbohydrate, nucleic acid, and protein pathways 
Significance of results – exactly how big of a difference is there?
What would be our future directions if all the questions above come back with negative answers? I.e. no correlation, insignificant results 

## Serum Metabolomics data format
What can we do with serum metabolomics? Is the format of the data such that functional analysis can be run (would not be possible with 16S region)? 

## Data processing
When reproducing figures for the project proposal, should we use code in the original paper? Do so exactly as the MICB 475 QIIME2 modules have outlined except for DADA2 denoising/clustering parameters? 
We have not started data processing yet 
## Is there any potential to change our meeting time? 
An alternative time all group members are available would be Wednesday 1PM, but we understand if this change cannot be accommodate
